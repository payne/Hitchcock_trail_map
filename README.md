I just finished digitizing the new Hitchcock trail map. Here it is in GeoJSON format. This has the trails only, no other amenities or features. I'll post GPX in a minute and can provide other formats if anybody wants them.
Please be aware that this could contain errors or inaccuracies. Use this map data at your own risk. I produced this data by georeferencing the new [Hitchcock trail map PDF](hitchcockmap_minimized_51237.pdf), then used QGIS with the Raster Tracer plugin to autotrace the trail on the map. I then made manual fixes as needed, matching the trails to aerial imagery where possible.

GPX version of new Hitchcock trail map. See my previous post for further information. Facebook doesn't seem to allow more than one file per post.
